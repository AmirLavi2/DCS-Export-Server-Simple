# DCS-Export-Server-Simple
A very basic TCP Server that receives data from DCS-World.

Beginners:
1. Go to ...\DCS-Export-Server-Simple\LUA. You will find various folders, each contains an Export.lua file.
2. Choose which of those files sound interesting to you and then rightclick --> COPY the file (not the folder!) to the clipboard.
3. IMPORTANT! Go to your [UserName]\SavedGames\DCS\Scripts folder and make a backup of your existing Export.lua file. YOU DON'T WANNA LOSE THIS FILE! If you don't have an Export.lua in there, don't worry. It means that you don't have any add-ons that need exported data (yet). 
4. Rightclick --> PASTE the Export.lua file from the clipboard into [UserName]\SavedGames\DCS\Scripts folder.
5. Go to ...\DCS-Export-Server-Simple\TCP-Server Console\bin\Release and run "TCP_Server Console.exe" You will get a black consle window with the server waiting for a DCS connection.
6. Start DCS, start a Mission and unpause the flight to watch the exported data show up in the console :-)

Play around and explore!
